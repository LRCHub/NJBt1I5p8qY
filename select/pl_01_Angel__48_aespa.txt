My guardian angel
Number forty-eight
Dreaming, feeling,
I keep visualizing
And now I'm getting it right
You're the love that
I'm attracting
Yeah,
it has always been you, boy
It will always be you
Manifest with no sacrificing
Send me love
Forty-eight, and I'm fantasizing
Say no more
I feel you coming to me
Come and never let go
Come and never let go
All I see is
Angel number forty-eight
All I need
Yeah, it keeps manifesting
On and on
Forty-eight and then I know
You'll come and never let go
Come and never let go
Everywhere
Angel number forty-eight
I create
With my guardian angel
On and on
Forty-eight and then I know
Come and never let go
Come and never let go
It has always been you, boy
It will always be you
You feel me?
So sweet,
there's just something about you
Giving me so much clarity
Pulling you in like gravity
My real life's just
like day dreaming
All my dreams,
they come true, boy
They will always come true
Manifest with no sacrificing
Send me love
Forty-eight, and I'm fantasizing
Say no more
I feel you coming to me
Come and never let go
Come and never let go
All I see is
Angel number forty-eight
All I need
